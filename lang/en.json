    "about.story.paragraph1": "BLUEPINE TECH FOUNDATION was born from a profound insight: while digital transformation sweeps across the globe, agriculture – the bedrock of civilization – still lags significantly behind in its digital journey. We witnessed the pervasive 'data silos' in the fields, the helplessness of smallholder farmers facing technological and capital barriers, and the value lost due to opacity in supply chains.",
