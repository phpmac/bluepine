    "about.story.paragraph1": "BLUEPINE TECH FOUNDATION was founded on a profound insight: in today's era where digital waves are sweeping the globe, agriculture—the foundation of civilization—remains sluggish in its digital transformation. We saw the ubiquitous \"data silos\" in the fields, witnessed the helplessness of smallholder farmers facing technological and capital barriers, and observed the value lost due to opacity in supply chains.",

    "about.story.paragraph3": "Thus, BLUEPINE TECH FOUNDATION came into being. We are not just a fund; we are a group of practitioners who firmly believe that technology can reshape reality. Starting with our flagship project, Agri-Eco Smart Chain, we are turning this vision into reality step by step, connecting wisdom with the harvest of the fields.",
